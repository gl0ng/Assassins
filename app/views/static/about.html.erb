  <h1>About Gotcha</h1>

  <h2>
    Gotcha is a live-action game. Players try to eliminate each other from the game using mock weapons in an effort to become the last surviving player. 
  </h2>
  <h2>
    Game hosts (also called admins) begin by advertising that a game is being set up and instruct potential players to register. Once enough players have signed up, the application assigns targets to the players when the admin decides to begin the game. A player is told the name of their target as collected during registation. The aim of the game is for players to track down and eliminate their targets until only one player remains. When a player eliminates their target, they get the victim's target(s). Only one player can eliminate a target at a time. If only one player remains, the game is over.
